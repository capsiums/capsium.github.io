== Capsium Specifications

Capsium is designed to provide a common architecture for portable, secure information interchange and unified management. Here are the detailed specifications:

=== Package Structure

A Capsium package typically includes:

* **Content**: Static files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* **Data**: Structured data files, such as YAML or JSON.
* **Metadata**: Descriptive information about the package, such as its name, version, and dependencies.
* **Routes**: Mapping of URLs to content or data endpoints.
* **Storage**: Definitions for datasets and their sources, formats, and schemas.

=== Package Configuration

Capsium packages are configured using JSON files, which include metadata, routes, storage, and other configurations.

=== Security Features

Capsium packages can be digitally signed and encrypted to ensure content integrity and security.

=== Deployment

Capsium packages can be deployed using a Capsium reactor, which reads the package configuration and serves the content and data according to the defined routes.
